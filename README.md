Sure! Here's the README file for your barcode generator project:

Barcode Generator
This project is a barcode generator using the barcode module in Python. It allows you to generate a sequence of Code 128 barcodes for a given range of numbers.

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd your_repository
Install the required dependencies:

pip install barcode
pip install python-barcode
Usage
Make sure you have installed the necessary dependencies (see "Installation" section).
Run the generate_barcodes.py script providing the start and end numbers to generate the barcode sequence.

python generate_barcodes.py <start_number> <end_number>
Replace <start_number> and <end_number> with the actual start and end numbers of the sequence you want to generate. For example, to generate barcodes from 10820231000 to 10820231200:

python generate_barcodes.py 10820231000 10820231200
Once the script is executed, it will generate the corresponding barcodes for each number in the specified range and save them as PNG images in the project directory.
Example

python generate_barcodes.py 1001 1010
This will generate barcodes for numbers 1001 to 1010.
